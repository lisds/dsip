# k-means clustering

Also see: [k-means
clustering](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.11-k-means.html)
in the [Python Data Science
Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook).  You'll see
much inspiration from that page here.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
```

We will use the famous [iris data
set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).  Quoting from the
Wikipedia page above:

> The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris
setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from
each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

```{python}
iris = pd.read_csv('data/iris.csv')
iris
```

```{python}
sns.pairplot(iris, hue='Name')
```

```{python}
features = ['PetalWidth', 'PetalLength']
measures = iris[features]
measures
```

```{python}
sns.scatterplot(iris,
                x=features[0],
                y=features[1],
                hue='Name')
```

[K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) is a technique for
splitting up (classifying) the data into *clusters* â€” groups of nearby points.
Here is Scikit-learn's k-means implementation.  We use it to identify clusters
in the data automatically, without using the species labels.  We define the
clusters by their *centers*. Notice though that the clusters it finds are very
similar to the clusters by species.

```{python}
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# n_init is the number of different starting states to try.
# The algorithm depends to some extent on starting state.
kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=3, n_init=10)
kmeans_model.fit(measures)
cluster_nos = kmeans_model.predict(measures)
```

```{python}
# The measures with Scikit-learn's cluster labels.
labeled_measures = measures.copy()
labeled_measures['cluster'] = cluster_nos
labeled_measures
```

These are Scikit-learn's cluster centers:

```{python}
kmeans_model.cluster_centers_
```

The clusters displayed graphically.  Notice how similar they are to the actual
species labels, that we have not used here.

```{python}
sns.scatterplot(labeled_measures,
                x=features[0],
                y=features[1],
                hue='cluster')
plt.scatter(kmeans_model.cluster_centers_[:, 0],
            kmeans_model.cluster_centers_[:, 1],
            color='r', s=100, alpha=0.5);
```

The algorithm of k-means is as follows.  We specify we want $k$ clusters, then:

1. **Select $k$ points at random** from the set to be the starting estimates of
   the cluster centers.
2. Repeat the following until the cluster center estimates do not change:

    A.  **Calculate the distance** of each point in the dataset to each of the
        $k$ clusters.<br>
    B.  **Allocate each point** to one of the clusters by choosing the cluster
        with the shortest distance to the point.<br>
    C.  With these allocations, **calculate new estimated cluster centers** by
        averaging the positions of all points in each cluster.<br>
    D.  **Check** if the new cluster centers estimate has **changed**.  If not
        we are finished.<br>


Remember the loop here as:

A. Calculate the distance.<br>
B. Allocate each point to one the centers.<br>
C. Calculate new centers.<br>
D. Check.<br>

```{python}
# Step 1: Select k points at random as starting estimates.
n_clusters = 3
cluster_names = np.array(['c0', 'c1', 'c2'])
df = iris[features]
# .sample does sampling without replacement by default.
centers = df.sample(n_clusters).set_index(cluster_names)
centers
```

This is step 2A - **calculate the distance** of each point to each each center.

```{python}
def distance(pt1, pt2):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((pt1 - pt2) ** 2))
```

```{python}
# An example distance.
distance(df.iloc[0], centers.iloc[0])
```

Calculate the distances between all clusters and all points:

```{python}
distances = pd.DataFrame()
# Distances of all points to cluster center 0
distances['c0'] = df.apply(
    distance,
    pt2=centers.iloc[0],
    axis=1)
# Distances of all points to cluster center 1
distances['c1'] = df.apply(
    distance,
    pt2=centers.iloc[1],
    axis=1)
# Distances of all points to cluster center 2
distances['c2'] = df.apply(
    distance,
    pt2=centers.iloc[2],
    axis=1)
distances
```

```{python}
# We can write the code above in a more compact way.
distances = pd.DataFrame()
for point_no, cluster_name in enumerate(cluster_names):
    distances[cluster_name] = df.apply(
        distance,
        pt2=centers.iloc[point_no],
        axis=1)
distances
```

Here are the points and the distances of the points from the three current
center estimates:

```{python}
pd.concat([df, distances], axis=1).round(4)
```

Step 2B - **allocate each point** to a cluster.  Now we can choose a cluster
for each point, by choosing the cluster center with the shortest distance to
the point.

```{python}
# Step 2B - allocate each point to a cluster by choosing nearest center
labels = distances.idxmin(axis=1)
labels
```

Step 2C - **calculate new estimated cluster centers**.  We estimate new cluster
centers by taking the average of the point coordinates, for the points we have
just allocated to each cluster.

```{python}
new_centers = df.groupby(labels).mean().set_index(cluster_names)
new_centers
```

The next step (2D) is to **check** whether `centers` and `new_centers` are the
same - in which case, we have finished the search, and we can stop.


Now let's run the whole search procedure.

```{python}
# Make a new random number generator with known state.
# We do this to make sure we get the optimum k-means
# "by accident" on the first run.
rng2 = np.random.default_rng(42)
```

```{python}
# Choose random points from set.
centers = df.sample(n_clusters,
                    random_state=rng2  # Use predictable rng
                   ).set_index(cluster_names)

# Repeat for a long time, if necessary.
for i in range(1000):

    # Find distances of each point to each center.
    distances = pd.DataFrame()
    for point_no, cluster_name in enumerate(cluster_names):
        distances[cluster_name] = df.apply(
            distance,
            pt2=centers.iloc[point_no],
            axis=1)
    # Allocate each point to one of the cluster (centers) by
    # choosing the closest center.
    labels = distances.idxmin(axis=1)

    # Make new centers with mean of points in cluster.
    new_centers = df.groupby(labels).mean().set_index(cluster_names)

    # See if we have the same centers as before.
    if np.all(centers == new_centers):
        break  # If same, then stop, we've finished.
    # Otherwise continue
    centers = new_centers
    # Show the current estimated centers.
    print(f'Centers after iteration {i}')
    display(centers)
```

```{python}
# Plot the points with their cluster labels.
sns.scatterplot(
    df,
    x=features[0],
    y=features[1],
    hue=labels)
# Plot the centers.
sns.scatterplot(
    centers,
    x=features[0],
    y=features[1],
    color='r',
    s=100,
    alpha=0.5);
```

```{python}
centers
```

Notice that the centers we found are the same as those that scikit-learn found.  Scikit-learn uses some tricks to make sure it found the right centers - that it didn't get stuck with some wrong starting points.   We cheated to make sure of this above, by setting the random number generator.

```{python}
kmeans_model.cluster_centers_
```

```{python}
# Scikit-learn clusters are (near as dammit) the same as
# the ones we found.  The order of the centers is arbitrary,
# solve by sorting.
assert np.allclose(
    np.sort(kmeans_model.cluster_centers_, axis=0),
    np.sort(centers, axis=0))
```

One measure of how well the points match the clusters is *inertia* - the sum of the squared distances between each point and its corresponding cluster.

```{python}
def center_difference_sq(sub_df):
    """ Squared difference between each point and matching center
    """
    return (sub_df - sub_df.mean(axis=0)) ** 2
```

```{python}
# .transform applies the function to each sub-dataframe.
df.groupby(labels).transform(center_difference_sq).sum().sum()
```

Scikit-learn does the same calculation.

```{python}
kmeans_model.inertia_
```
