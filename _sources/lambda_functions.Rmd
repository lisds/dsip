# Lambda functions

```{python}
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Here are some estimated global temperature data, from 1850 through 2000.

See the [dataset page](https://github.com/odsti/datasets/tree/main/berkeley_global) for more detail.

```{python}
temperatures = pd.read_csv('data/global_temperature_quarters.csv')
temperatures
```

Imagine a function like this:

```{python}
def degrees_c_to_f(c):
    return c * 1.8 + 32
```

Notice that `degrees_c_to_f` is now a value, that is of type `function`:

```{python}
degrees_c_to_f
```

```{python}
degrees_c_to_f(0)
```

```{python}
degrees_c_to_f(10)
```

```{python}
temperatures['Temperature'].apply(degrees_c_to_f)
```

Sometimes we don't want to go to the bother of typing out the whole function with its `def` and name.   In that case we may want to use a `lambda` function.

A `lambda` function is a short-hand for defining a function, the doesn't need a `def` and does not define a function name.  It is a way of giving the recipe in a single expression.  For example, here is an expression that defines the same function as we saw above, but using `lambda`:

```{python}
lambda c : c * 1.8 + 32
```

Notice that this expression, like the `def` block above, results in an expression.  Notice too that this function does not have a name.


We could give this function a name by attaching the result of the expression to a variable, with our usual assignment statement:

```{python}
c2f_func = lambda c : c * 1.8 + 32
```

We can then use the function just as we used the `def` function we defined before:

```{python}
c2f_func(0)
```

```{python}
c2f_func(10)
```

Notice the structure of the `lambda` expression.

First we have `lambda`.

Then we have the *argument name* or names, in our case `c`.  This is the name that the function argument will get when we call the function.   For example, when we call `c2f_func(0)`, `c` will get the value 0.

Next we have a colon `:` to signal that the function body follows.  For a `lambda`, the function body must be an expression.  Remember, an expression is code that returns a value.

In our case, the expression is `c * 1.8 + 32`.

```{python}
temperatures['Temperature'].apply(c2f_func)
```

Why would we use this `lambda` shortcut?   Just because it is a shortcut.   We could write our whole conversion like this:

```{python}
temperatures['Temperature'].apply(lambda c : c * 1.8 + 32)
```

rather than:

```{python}
def degrees_c_to_f(c):
    return c * 1.8 + 32

temperatures['Temperature'].apply(degrees_c_to_f)
```

In fact, a lambda function can have more than one argument.  In that case you name the arguments before the colon, and then use them in the function expression:

```{python}
# arguments are c and z, where z is the value in Fahrenheit
# at zero centigrade.
c2f_two = lambda c, z : c * 1.8 + z
```

```{python}
c2f_two(0, 32)
```

```{python}
c2f_two(10, 32)
```

We can't as easily use these two-argument lambdas for Pandas `apply` functions, because apply functions only accept one argument, by default.
