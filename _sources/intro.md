# Data Science in Practice

This is a hands-on course teaching the practical and reproducible data
analysis. We will teach you how to work with data and code to get a deeper
understanding of how data science methods work, how they can fail, how to fix
them, and how to develop new methods. We will cover intermediate concepts in
data science, and how they relate to the wider world of statistics,
engineering and computer science. At the same time we will teach you techniques
of data analysis that will make your work easier to organize, understand,
explain and share. Using this techniques will give you great benefits for
collaborating with others, and for making your work reproducible.

At the end of the course we expect you to have good insight into a range of
techniques for data science, and to be skilled in using Python to track and
share your work standard tools such as version control, testing and code
review.
