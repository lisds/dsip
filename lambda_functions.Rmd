# Lambda functions

```{python}
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Here are some estimated global temperature data, from 1850 through 2000.

See the [dataset page](https://github.com/odsti/datasets/tree/main/berkeley_global) for more detail.

```{python}
temperatures = pd.read_csv('data/global_temperature_quarters.csv')
temperatures
```

Imagine a function like this:

```{python}
def degrees_c_to_f(c):
    return c * 1.8 + 32
```

Notice that `degrees_c_to_f` is now a value, that is of type `function`:

```{python}
degrees_c_to_f
```

```{python}
degrees_c_to_f(0)
```

```{python}
degrees_c_to_f(10)
```

```{python}
temperatures['Temperature'].apply(degrees_c_to_f)
```

Sometimes we don't want to go to the bother of typing out the whole function with its `def` and name.   In that case we may want to use a `lambda` function.

A `lambda` function is a short-hand for defining a function, the doesn't need a `def` and does not define a function name.  It is a way of giving the recipe in a single expression.  For example, here is an expression that defines the same function as we saw above, but using `lambda`:

```{python}
lambda c : c * 1.8 + 32
```

Notice that this expression, like the `def` block above, results in an expression.  Notice too that this function does not have a name.


We could give this function a name by attaching the result of the expression to a variable, with our usual assignment statement:

```{python}
c2f_func = lambda c : c * 1.8 + 32
```

We can then use the function just as we used the `def` function we defined before:

```{python}
c2f_func(0)
```

```{python}
c2f_func(10)
```

Notice the structure of the `lambda` expression.

1. `lambda` then
2. the argument(s) to the new function, here `c`, then
3. `:` then
4. a single expression, here `c * 1.8 + 32`.

After `lambda` we have the *argument name* or names, in our case `c`.  This
is the name that the function argument will get when we call the function.
For example, when we call `c2f_func(0)`, `c` will get the value 0.

The colon `:` signals that the function body follows.  For a `lambda`, the
function body must be an expression.  Remember, an expression is code that
returns a value.

In our case, the expression is `c * 1.8 + 32`.

```{python}
temperatures['Temperature'].apply(c2f_func)
```

Why would we use this `lambda` shortcut?   Just because it is a shortcut.
We could write our whole conversion like this:

```{python}
temperatures['Temperature'].apply(lambda c : c * 1.8 + 32)
```

rather than:

```{python}
def degrees_c_to_f(c):
    return c * 1.8 + 32

temperatures['Temperature'].apply(degrees_c_to_f)
```

## More than one argument

The lambda function above has a single argument, and this is typical of
lambda functions that you might use with Pandas `apply`.  But, in general,
lambda functions can have more than one argument.

For example, consider the case where you wanted to allow the function to
work with degrees in Celsius, or degrees in Kelvin.  You may remember that
one degree on the Celsius scale is the same as one degree on the Kelvin
scale â€” but Celsius has 0 at the melting point of water, and Kelvin sets
0 at absolute 0.  Therefore 0 degrees in Celsius is 273.15 degrees in
Kelvin.

We can take this into account in our function, but adding a second argument,
which gives the temperature for zero in the given scale.

For example, to converting 10 degrees in Celsius to Fahrenheit we multiply
by 1.8 and add the number of Fahrenheit degrees for 0 Celsius.

```{python}
# 10 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit
10 * 1.8 + 32
```

Converting 10 degrees in Kelvin to Fahrenheit involves multiplying by 1.8
and add the number of Fahrenheit degrees for 0 Kelvin.

```{python}
zero_k_in_f = 32 - 273.15 * 1.8
zero_k_in_f
```

Therefore, to convert from Kelvin to Fahrenheit

```{python}
# 10 degrees Kelvin to Fahrenheit
10 * 1.8 + zero_k_in_f
```

We can use a second argument to our lambda to take this into account, which
is the Fahrenheit value for 0 in (Celsius or Kelvin).

To use two (or more) arguments to a lambda, you name the arguments before
the colon, and then use them in the function expression.

Here is a more general lambda, taking two arguments, the first for the
degrees in (Celsius or Kelvin), the second for the Fahrenheit value of 0 on
the relevant scale: 32 for Celsius, `32 - 273.15 * 1.8 =  -459.67` for
Kelvin.


```{python}
# arguments are c and z, where z is the value in Fahrenheit
# at zero on the given scale (Celsius or Kelvin).
c2f_again = lambda c, z : c * 1.8 + z
```

Use the two-argument function to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```{python}
c2f_again(10, 32)
```

Use the two-argument function to convert from Kelvin to Fahrenheit:

```{python}
c2f_again(10, -459.67)
```

We can't as easily use these two-argument lambdas for Pandas `apply`
functions, because apply functions only accept one argument, by default.
